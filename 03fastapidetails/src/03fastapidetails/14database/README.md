# 🌟 FastAPI Database Adventure

## What This Code Does (Big Picture)
Imagine you have a magical library where you can store and organize all your favorite books and toys! This code helps us create a special storage system where we can keep track of users and their items. It's like having a friendly librarian who helps us organize everything in neat shelves and can find anything we need! 

## Step 1: Getting Our Magic Tools 🛠️
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, relationship
```
This brings in our special library tools:
- SQLAlchemy for creating magical shelves
- SessionMaker for managing our library visits
- Relationship for connecting books to their owners

## Step 2: Setting Up Our Library 📚
```python
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./sql_app.db"
engine = create_engine(SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL)
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
```
This creates our magical library:
- A special place to store all our books
- A way to organize everything neatly
- A system to keep track of all our visitors

## Step 3: Creating Our Library Cards 👤
```python
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    email = Column(String, unique=True, index=True)
    hashed_password = Column(String)
    is_active = Column(String, default=True)
```
This creates our library card system:
- Each visitor gets a special card
- Their email is like their library card number
- We can keep track of who's active

## Step 4: Making Our Book Shelves 📖
```python
class Item(Base):
    __tablename__ = "items"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    title = Column(String, index=True)
    description = Column(String, index=True)
    owner_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"))
```
This creates our book organization system:
- Each book has a special number
- We can add titles and descriptions
- We know which books belong to which visitor

## Final Summary 📌
✅ We created a magical library system
✅ We can keep track of all our visitors
✅ We can organize books and items
✅ We can find anything we need quickly

## Try It Yourself! 🚀
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Install FastAPI with all the standard tools using uv:
   ```
