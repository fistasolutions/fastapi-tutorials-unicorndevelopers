# 🌟 FastAPI Response Cookies Adventure

## What This Code Does (Big Picture)
Imagine you have a magical toy store where you can give each visitor a special memory card when they leave! This code shows how to send cookies back to visitors in your responses. It's like giving each visitor a magical card that helps them remember their visit to your store!

## Step 1: Getting Our Magic Tools 🛠️
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Response
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
```
This line brings in FastAPI and special tools for sending cookies back to visitors.

## Step 2: Creating Our Digital Toy Store 🏪
```python
app = FastAPI()
```
This creates our digital toy store where we'll keep our items.

## Step 3: Making Our Cookie Sender 🍪
```python
@app.get("/create-cookie/")
async def create_cookie():
    response = JSONResponse(content={"message": "Here's your cookie!"})
    response.set_cookie(key="last_visit", value="today")
    response.set_cookie(
        key="favorite_toy",
        value="robot",
        max_age=3600,  # Cookie lasts for 1 hour
        httponly=True  # Makes the cookie more secure
    )
    return response
```
This creates a special way to send cookies:
- `last_visit` remembers when they visited
- `favorite_toy` remembers their favorite toy
- `max_age` makes the cookie disappear after an hour
- `httponly` makes the cookie safer

## Step 4: Creating Our Cookie Deleter 🗑️
```python
@app.get("/delete-cookie/")
async def delete_cookie():
    response = JSONResponse(content={"message": "Cookie deleted!"})
    response.delete_cookie(key="favorite_toy")
    return response
```
This creates a special way to remove cookies:
- `delete_cookie` makes the cookie disappear
- It's like erasing the memory card

## Final Summary 📌
✅ We created a website that can give visitors special cookies
✅ We learned how to set cookies with different options
✅ We can make cookies that last for a specific time
✅ We can delete cookies when we don't need them anymore

## Try It Yourself! 🚀
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Install FastAPI with all the standard tools using uv:
   ```
   uv add "fastapi[standard]"
   ```
3. Save the code in a file named `15responsecookies.py`
4. Run the website using uv:
   ```
   uv run fastapi dev 15responsecookies.py
   ```
5. Visit these URLs in your browser:
   - `http://127.0.0.1:8000/create-cookie/` (Gets you a cookie!)
   - `http://127.0.0.1:8000/delete-cookie/` (Makes the cookie disappear!)
   - Check your browser's cookies to see them appear and disappear!
