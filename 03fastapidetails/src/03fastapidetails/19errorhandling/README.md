# 🌟 FastAPI Error Handling Adventure

## What This Code Does (Big Picture)
Imagine you have a magical toy store where sometimes things don't go exactly as planned! This code shows how to handle errors gracefully, like when someone asks for a toy that doesn't exist or tries to buy more toys than we have. It's like having a friendly store helper who knows exactly what to say when something goes wrong!

## Step 1: Getting Our Magic Tools 🛠️
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError
from fastapi.responses import PlainTextResponse
```
This line brings in FastAPI and special tools for handling errors nicely.

## Step 2: Creating Our Digital Toy Store 🏪
```python
app = FastAPI()
```
This creates our digital toy store where we'll keep our items.

## Step 3: Making Our Error Handler 🚨
```python
@app.exception_handler(RequestValidationError)
async def validation_exception_handler(request, exc):
    return PlainTextResponse(
        str(exc),
        status_code=400
    )
```
This creates a special way to handle validation errors:
- It catches errors when someone sends wrong information
- It tells them what went wrong in a friendly way
- `status_code=400` means "Oops, something's not right!"

## Step 4: Creating Our Custom Error Messages 📝
```python
@app.get("/toys/{toy_id}")
async def read_toy(toy_id: int):
    if toy_id > 100:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=404,
            detail="Oh no! We don't have that many toys!"
        )
    return {"toy_id": toy_id, "name": f"Toy #{toy_id}"}
```
This creates friendly error messages:
- It checks if someone asks for a toy we don't have
- It sends a nice message explaining what went wrong
- It helps visitors understand what they can do differently

## Final Summary 📌
✅ We created a website that handles errors nicely
✅ We learned how to show friendly error messages
✅ We can catch different types of problems
✅ We can help visitors understand what went wrong
