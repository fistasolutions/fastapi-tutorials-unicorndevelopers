# 🌟 FastAPI Hello World Adventure

## What This Code Does (Big Picture)
Imagine you have a magical door that can talk to people on the internet! This code creates a simple website that says "Hello World" when someone visits it. It's like having a friendly robot that waves and says hello to everyone who comes to your digital house!

## Step 1: Getting Our Magic Tools 🛠️
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
```
This line brings in FastAPI, which is like our magic toolbox for building websites. Think of it as getting all the LEGO pieces we need to build our digital house!

## Step 2: Creating Our Digital House 🏠
```python
app = FastAPI()
```
This creates our digital house (or website). It's like setting up the foundation of our LEGO house where we'll put all our cool stuff!

## Step 3: Making Our Welcome Door 🚪
```python
@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```
This creates a special door (endpoint) in our digital house:
- `@app.get("/")` means "when someone visits our main door"
- `async def root()` is like telling our robot what to do
- `return {"message": "Hello World"}` is our robot waving and saying hello!

## Final Summary 📌
✅ We created a simple website using FastAPI
✅ We made a special door that welcomes visitors
✅ When someone visits, they get a friendly "Hello World" message

## Try It Yourself! 🚀
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Install FastAPI and uvicorn using uv:

   uv add fastapi uvicorn
   ```
3. Save the code in a file named `01helloworld.py`
4. Run the website using uv:
   ```
   uv run fastapi dev 01helloworld.py
   ```
5. Open your web browser and visit: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

## What You'll Learn 🧠
- How to create a simple website using FastAPI
- How to make a basic endpoint (digital door)
- How to return messages to visitors
- How to run a web server

## Fun Things to Try! 🎮
1. Change the message to say something else, like "Welcome to my website!"
