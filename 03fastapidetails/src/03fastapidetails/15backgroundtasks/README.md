# 🌟 FastAPI Background Tasks Adventure

## What This Code Does (Big Picture)
Imagine you have a magical post office where you can send messages to your friends! This code helps us send messages and do other tasks while we continue playing. It's like having friendly helper elves who take care of sending your letters while you can do other fun things! 

## Step 1: Getting Our Magic Tools 🛠️
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, BackgroundTasks
from pydantic import BaseModel
import time
import logging
```
This brings in our special post office tools:
- BackgroundTasks for our helper elves
- Pydantic for creating message templates
- Logging to keep track of what our elves are doing

## Step 2: Creating Our Message System 📨
```python
class Notification(BaseModel):
    message: str
    email: str
    priority: Optional[str] = "normal"
```
This creates our message system:
- Each message has special content
- We know where to send it
- We can mark some messages as more important

## Step 3: Making Our Helper Elves 🧝
```python
def send_email(email: str, message: str):
    logger.info(f"Sending email to {email}")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate work
    logger.info(f"Email sent to {email}: {message}")
```
This creates our helper elves who:
- Take care of sending messages
- Work in the background
- Let us know when they're done

## Step 4: Creating Our Post Office Routes 📬
```python
@app.post("/notifications/")
async def create_notification(
    notification: Notification, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks
):
    background_tasks.add_task(send_email, notification.email, notification.message)
    return {"message": "Notification will be sent in the background"}
```
This creates our post office system:
- We can send messages anytime
- Our helper elves take care of them
- We can do other things while they work

## Final Summary 📌
✅ We created a magical post office system
✅ We can send messages without waiting
✅ We can do many things at once
✅ We can keep track of everything
