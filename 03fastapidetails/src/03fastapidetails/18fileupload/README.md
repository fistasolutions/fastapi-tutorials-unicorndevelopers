# 🌟 FastAPI File Upload Adventure

## What This Code Does (Big Picture)
Imagine you have a magical toy store where visitors can share pictures of their favorite toys! This code shows how to handle file uploads, like when someone wants to share a photo or drawing. It's like having a magical photo album that can collect and store pictures from all your visitors!

## Step 1: Getting Our Magic Tools 🛠️
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile
from typing import Annotated
```
This line brings in FastAPI and special tools for handling file uploads.

## Step 2: Creating Our Digital Toy Store 🏪
```python
app = FastAPI()
```
This creates our digital toy store where we'll keep our items.

## Step 3: Making Our Simple File Uploader 📸
```python
@app.post("/uploadfile/")
async def create_upload_file(
    file: UploadFile
):
    return {
        "filename": file.filename,
        "content_type": file.content_type
    }
```
This creates a special way to upload files:
- `file` is the file being uploaded
- `filename` tells us what the file is called
- `content_type` tells us what kind of file it is

## Step 4: Creating Our Multiple File Uploader 🖼️
```python
@app.post("/uploadfiles/")
async def create_upload_files(
    files: list[UploadFile]
):
    return {
        "filenames": [file.filename for file in files],
        "total": len(files)
    }
```
This creates a way to upload many files at once:
- `files` is a list of all the files
- It tells us how many files were uploaded
- It gives us all the filenames

## Final Summary 📌
✅ We created a website that can handle file uploads
✅ We learned how to work with single and multiple files
✅ We can check what types of files are uploaded
✅ We can process different kinds of files

## Try It Yourself! 🚀
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Install FastAPI with all the standard tools using uv:
   ```
   uv add "fastapi[standard]"
   ```
3. Save the code in a file named `18fileupload.py`
4. Run the website using uv:
