# 🛡️ FastAPI Security Guard Adventure

## What This Code Does (Big Picture)
Imagine you're running a magical toy store with super-smart security guards and special strength testers! The security guards (like bouncers at a party) make sure only the right people can come in, and the strength testers (like gym trainers) make sure our store can handle lots of visitors at once. It's like having a team of friendly superheroes protecting our magical toy store! 

## Step 1: Getting Our Security Tools 🛠️
```python
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer
from jose import jwt
from passlib.context import CryptContext
```
This brings in our special security tools:
- Special badges for visitors (JWT tokens)
- Secret code makers (password hashers)
- Security guard rules (OAuth2)
- Magic shields (middleware)

## Step 2: Setting Up Our Security System 🚨
```python
class SecurityMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
        # Security checks
```
This creates our security system that:
- Checks visitor badges
- Watches for troublemakers
- Protects against bad magic
- Keeps everyone safe

## Step 3: Creating Our Strength Tests 💪
```python
class UserBehavior(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 2)
    @task
    def get_user_profile(self):
        # Test store strength
```
This creates our strength tests that:
- Send pretend visitors
- Try different store doors
- Check how much we can handle
- Make sure everything stays fast

## Step 4: Adding Special Powers ✨
```python
RATE_LIMIT_RULES = {
    "default": "100/minute",
    "login": "5/minute"
}
```
This adds magical powers that:
- Control visitor traffic
- Prevent too many visits
- Keep the store running smoothly
- Stop any sneaky tricks

## Final Summary 📌
✅ We set up security guards
✅ We made strength tests
✅ We added traffic control
✅ We protected our store

## Try It Yourself! 🚀
1. Make sure you have Python installed
2. Install FastAPI and security tools using uv:
   ```
   uv add "fastapi[standard]" python-jose[cryptography] passlib[bcrypt] locust redis
   ```
3. Save the code in a file named `29securityloadtesting.py`
4. Start Redis (our magical helper):
   ```
   redis-server
   ```
5. Run the website using uv:
   ```
   uv run fastapi dev 29securityloadtesting.py
   ```
6. Run strength tests with Locust:
   ```
   uv run locust -f 29securityloadtesting.py
   ```

## What You'll Learn 🧠
- How to protect your store
- How to handle many visitors
- How to stop bad guys
- How to test your store's strength

## Fun Things to Try! 🎮
1. Create different security rules
2. Test with lots of visitors
3. Try breaking in safely
4. Watch the security work

## Cool Features! ✨
- Security guards (middleware)
- Visitor badges (JWT)
- Traffic control (rate limiting)
- Strength testing (Locust)

## Special Security Powers 🌟
### Security Guards:
- Check visitor badges
- Watch for bad behavior
- Protect secret areas
- Keep everyone safe

### Strength Testing:
- Send test visitors
- Measure store speed
- Find weak spots
- Make things stronger

## Example Security Tests 🎯
1. Test visitor badges:
```python
@app.post("/token")
async def login_for_access_token(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm):
    # Check visitor credentials
    return {"access_token": token}
```

2. Test store strength:
```python
class StoreVisitor(HttpUser):
    @task
    def visit_store(self):
        # Try to enter store
        self.client.get("/store")
```

## Security Checklist 📋
1. Visitor Protection:
   - Check badges (authentication)
   - Control traffic (rate limiting)
   - Block bad visitors (IP blocking)
   - Protect messages (HTTPS)

2. Store Protection:
   - Secure headers
   - CORS rules
   - XSS protection
   - CSRF protection

Happy coding! 🎉 Remember, security and load testing are like having friendly superheroes who protect your magical toy store and make sure it's strong enough for all your visitors!
