# 🌟 FastAPI WebSocket Adventure

## What This Code Does (Big Picture)
Imagine you have a magical walkie-talkie system where you can talk to your friends instantly! This code helps us create a special communication system where messages appear right away, like having a magical messenger who can instantly deliver your notes to your friends. It's like having a secret club where everyone can chat and share news in real-time! 

## Step 1: Getting Our Magic Tools 🛠️
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket, WebSocketDisconnect
from typing import List, Dict
import json
import asyncio
```
This brings in our special walkie-talkie tools:
- WebSocket for instant messaging
- JSON for creating magical message formats
- Asyncio for handling multiple conversations

## Step 2: Creating Our Club Manager 👥
```python
class ConnectionManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.active_connections: Dict[str, List[WebSocket]] = {
            "chat": [],
            "notifications": []
        }
```
This creates our club manager who:
- Keeps track of all club members
- Has different rooms for chatting and news
- Makes sure everyone gets their messages

## Step 3: Making Our Magic Walkie-Talkies 📱
```python
@app.websocket("/ws/{client_id}")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket, client_id: str):
    await manager.connect(websocket, client_id, "chat")
    try:
        while True:
            data = await websocket.receive_text()
            message = {
                "client_id": client_id,
                "message": data,
                "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
            }
            await manager.broadcast(json.dumps(message), "chat")
```
This creates our magical walkie-talkies that:
- Let friends join the conversation
- Send messages instantly
- Tell everyone who sent what message
- Keep track of when messages were sent

## Step 4: Creating Our News Messenger 📰
```python
@app.websocket("/ws/notifications/{client_id}")
async def notification_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket, client_id: str):
    await manager.connect(websocket, client_id, "notifications")
    try:
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(5)
            notification = {
                "type": "notification",
                "message": f"New notification for {client_id}",
                "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
            }
            await manager.send_personal_message(json.dumps(notification), websocket)
```
This creates our news messenger who:
- Sends special news to each friend
- Delivers messages every 5 seconds
- Makes sure everyone gets their own news
